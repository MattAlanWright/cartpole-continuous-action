# CartPole Continuous

Modified version of the OPenAI Gym CartPole environment (https://github.com/openai/gym/tree/master/gym/envs/classic_control) to accept real-valued actions. Actions between -1.0 and +1.0 are accepted. These translate to a 50.0N push to the left and a 50.0N push to the right, respectively, with a linear translation to values in between.

For installation instructions see https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/docs/creating-environments.md
